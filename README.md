# 2024 DevCreate Hackathon 2k24 - Examwiz üöÄ

## Background

In universities, managing exam seating plans efficiently is crucial to ensure a smooth examination process. Traditionally, this process involves manual creation of seating arrangements by administrative staff, leading to potential errors and inefficiencies. Additionally, students often face challenges in accessing their seating plan information in a timely manner.

## Problem

The current manual process of creating and managing exam seating plans at our university is prone to errors and lacks efficiency. Administrators are burdened with the task of manually creating seating arrangements for each exam, while students face difficulties in accessing their seating plan information in a timely manner.

## Solution

To address these challenges, we propose the development of a University Exam Seating Plan Management System. This system will provide an intuitive platform for administrators to create and manage exam seating plans digitally. Additionally, students will have easy access to their seating plan information through a mobile application.

## Features

- **Admin Management:** The admin can create sub-admin accounts for each department in the university.
- **Exam Creation:** Sub-admins can create exams based on the academic year and upload seating plans for those exams.
- **Seating Plan Visibility:** Sub-admins can set a timer for when the seating plan will be visible to students.
- **Student Notification:** Students receive notifications with their seating plan details (room number, row number, column number) when the timer expires.
- **Search Feature:** Students can search for seating plan data by entering the roll number of another student.
- **Calendar Feature:** Students can check the calendar for upcoming exam details.
